DLP Software - Host Based DLP searches systems for sensitive info and alerts admin, host based DLP can also block actions like blocking unauthorized USB media. Network Based DLP - Monitor for transmission of sensitve info by blocking or encrypting. 

DLP uses Pattern Matching - finding patterns of senstive info like SSN or credit card numbers, finding sensitive terms on docs too.  Watermarking - files are tagged and actions made to tagged items. 

Cloud-Based DLP are also available for a service that does not require maintance and lower operating requirements. 

### Cloud access security brokers
CASB - Network Based, sits between cloud and client to block requests that can cause security issues. API Based, sits in cloud querying for security issues, may not be real time.

Configuration Management - Track specific Device settings. Versioning - Assigns a number to each version of a software. Normally 3 part decimal (ie. 1.1.1) Baseline - Expected settings of a system, a snapshot. 

Standardize Naming and IP assignment to help track hardware and software .

### Physical asset management
Media Management - Track highly sensitive data on media hardware. 

### Supply chain vulnerabilities
End-of-Sale - No longer offered for purchase but still supported | End-of-Support - Vendor will reduce or stop support of a product, reduced security updates. | End-of-Life - No support at all, no support questions or security patching available
