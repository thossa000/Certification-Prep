# ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Lead Auditor
Notes for review for the ISO 27001:2022 Lead Auditor certification exam.

# The Basics
## History and Background
ISO stands for International Organization for Standardization

Established in 1947 by a group of engineers to develop standards for quality, safety, and efficiency. Now recognized globally across private and public sectors for all industries.

The ISO 27001 standard is tailored to each organization to best fit the requirements of the standard.

ISO comprises National Standardization Bodies (NSBs) from over 160 countries. NSBs contribute via consensus, ensuring global representation for comprehensive standards development. Notable NSBs include:

1. USA: American National Accreditation Board (ANAB)
2. UK: British Standard Institution (BSI)

Standards are developed by Technical Committees (TCs) of SMEs from industry, government, and academia. Joint TCs are groups of TCs and Subcommittees (SCs)

- JTC 1 covers Information Technology (IT)
- JTC1/SC 27 develop ISO 27000 series (ISMS)

### Benefits of ISO:
1. Standards build trust and credibility
2. Cost savings
3. Operational efficiency
4. enhanced marketability
5. Basis for legal/regulatory requirements and procurement processes

## Accreditation vs. Certification

Accreditation: Validates that a Certification Body is competent to perform a certification body.

Certification: Validates that an organization meets the requirements of a specific ISO standard. Performed by a Accredited Certification Body.

CBs assess whether an organization's management system confirms to the ISO standard. Accreditation is voluntary for CBs, however when they certify an organization it will miss stamps showing the governing body that accredits the CBs.

ISO 17021-1 defines the requirements for CBs to achieve accreditation. This defines the processes and audit evidence management requirements, the competencies required for and auditor, and consistencies in audit conduct/practices and time allocation. CBs are audited annually by the accreditation bodies for ongoing compliance.

ABs undergo peer evaluations through the International Accreditation Forum (IAF). ABs oversee CBs to ensure checks and balances. 

IAF CertSearch is a public Certification Database to view all certifications issued by an accredited CB. This allows people to validate an organization certificate received from a accredited CB.

Unaccredited certificates lack market trust and recognition since they are not validated by an AB recognized globally through the IAF MLA (Multilateral Recognition Arrangement).

## Multi-year Audit Cycles
ISO certification is typically a 3-year audit cycle

- Year 1: Initial Certification Audit (2 Stages)
- Year 2: First Surveillance Audit
- Year 3: Second Surveillance Audit
- Year 4: Recertification Audit (1 Stage)

### Initial Certification Audit's 2 Stages
- Stage 1: Reviews the design of the management system and governance documentation
- Stage 2: Assesses the implementation and effectiveness of the management system

After each stage is passed, a recommendation is made by the auditor to a decision commitee (in the same CB) impartial to the audit to proceed to the next stage, once the decision commitee passes stage 2, the ISO27001 certification is granted for 3 years (subject to success annual surveillance audits).

### Surveillance Audits
Conducted to verify continued conformity to ISO standards:
- Review prior nonconformities and corrective actions
- Changes to the organization or certification scope
- High-risk areas identified by the auditor or organization.

Non-compliance with surveillance audits can result in certification suspension and withdrawal.

### Recertification Audit
Performed at the end of the 3-year cycle to reassess the entirety of the management system. Similar to Initial Certification Audit but conducted in a single stage workstream. Successful recertification generated a renewed cert with a new 3-year expiration. Failing recertification causes suspension/withdrawal.

Multi-year audit cycles promotes:
- Continual Improvement
- Alignment with system goals and organizational priorities
- Risk prioritization and identification
- Corrective actions for security gaps

Nonconformities (NC):

- Minor NC: does not affect the capability of the management system to achieve intended result
- Major NC: affects the capability of the management system to achieve intended result

NCs are typically not raised in Stage 1 certification audits, they are instead called Areas of Concern (AOC). AOCs do not explicitly require correction but can turn to NCs in future audits.

NCs are addresses via short-term corrections and long-term corrective actions.
- Corrections: Resolve the detected issue
- Corrective Action: Identify and resolve the root cause to prevent reoccurrence

Auditors review Corrective Actions for existing NCs before recertifying. Unresolved NCs or ineffective corrective actions can lead to certification suspension/withdrawal.

### Common Challenges
- Resource constraints: Budget cuts and staff changes
- Process changes: New tools or processes might cause failures with ISO requirements
- Scope changes: Adding products, services, or acquisitions to certification scope with implementing proper controls

### Lead Auditor Priorities
- Tailoring Audits: Each audit requires different focus, initial certification is comprehensive, while surveillance audits target high-risk areas or new elements
- Tracking Corrective Actions: Maintain corrective actions tracker for visibility and remediations of NCs
- Risk Management: Ensure risks are reviewed, updated and mitigated at least once annually to promote continuous improvement.
